# Project Title uLtRa

The Crosson project is a business website developed by a team comprising Rita, Esther Godson, and Chidozie, focusing on delivering a professional online presence. Built with HTML and CSS, it integrates Google Fonts (Montserrat) for typography and emphasizes responsive design through viewport settings, flexible layouts using Flexbox, and relative units like vh. Key features include a structured header with contact details, social media icons, and language selection, alongside navigation tabs for seamless access to sections like Products, Solutions, and Services. The UI prioritizes clean aesthetics with subtle shadows, bordered sections, and a mobile-first approach. Roles were distributed to optimize development: Rita handled Services, Godson designed the About section, Esther managed UI/UX, and Chidozie oversaw version control. The site aims to enhance business visibility, user engagement, and accessibility across devices.
